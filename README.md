# Higgs Boson Detection

### Abstractâ€”At CERN, the direct observation of Higgs bosonsis impossible due to their short life. Instead, one can deter-minate whether a proton collision generates a Higgs boson byanalysing the decay. A good way to process this huge amount ofdata and create a prediction model is to use machine learningtechniques. In this work we present how we build a model thatcombines a least squares regression and a Ridge regularizationin order to best predict whether a given set of data is due tothe creation of a Higgs boson.
