% The second parameter is the width of the figure normalized to column width

% The third parameter is the caption.

\begin{abstract}
The abstract should really be written last, along with the title of
the paper. The four points that should be covered:
\begin{enumerate}
\item State the problem.
\item Say why it is an interesting problem.
\item Say what your solution achieves.
\item Say what follows from your solution.

\section{Introduction}
The Higgs boson is an elementary particle discovered at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in 2013. In order to produce it, physicists accelerate protons and make them collide at high speeds. In some rare cases, the collision generates a Higgs boson. A major problem that arises when scientists want to observe the particle is that its life is very short. Indeed, a Higgs boson quickly decays into other particles. For that reason, it is observed indirectly by looking at the outputs of the decay. However, this process can become tricky because a Higgs boson's decay signature can be very much alike another particle's signature.\\
In this paper, a machine learning method that efficiently estimates the likelihood that a given measurement is due to a Higgs boson or some other particles is presented... ADD SOME DETAILS ABOUT THE METHOD HERE.\\
Two specific data sets are used to optimize the method. The first set $S_{t}$ is called the training set and contains 250000 observations. It is used to develop the model. The second set $S_{v}$ is the validation set and has 568238 events. These data are used to validate the model and make sure that we the model does not overfit the data of $S_t$. In both sets, the events are characterized by 30 features. Among them, 13 are "raw" quantities about the bunch collision as measured by the detector and 17 are quantities computed from the raw features, which were selected by the physicists. Finally, let's point out that in some cases the variables of some entries are not available. In order to handle the missing data, it is primordial to apply a preprocessing stage.
