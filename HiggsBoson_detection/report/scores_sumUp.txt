The starting point is the least square with a polynomial basis of degree 2 gives a score kaggle of 0.65773 without preprocessing the missing value. If we take care of the missing vaules (-999) 
the scores increase to 0.77176 staying with the same degree 2. According to the cross validation there is no need to increase the polynomial degree in this case.
If the prediction is based on a ridge regression  of degree 5 and lambda of 0.0001t the score reaches 0.78581. With the same hyperparameters with the same preprocessingof the least square the scores 
is 0.79676. The scores increases a little bit by dropping the features 11 and 18. So our final score is 0.79693 using ridge with lambda 0.0001 and a degree of oly of 5 with preprocessing.
